Triangle Madness
=================

Updated 03/05/2013

A program that will solve for the area, perimeter, and missing sides and angles of a triangle when given certain specifications.

This program has been created with specific restrictions placed by the course teacher (e.g. getters and setters that are never used).

Worked with Clement (Cinnabon).
